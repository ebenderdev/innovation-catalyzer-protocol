# Innovation Catalyzer Protocol

The **Innovation Catalyzer Protocol** is a Clarity smart contract framework designed to facilitate secure, transparent, and time-bound resource commitment for decentralized innovation projects. It empowers participants and initiative originators with configurable contribution mechanisms, resource withdrawal logic, and enhanced security features like velocity controls and stewardship transitions.

## üõ† Features

- **Initiative Registration & Archiving**  
  Tracks initiative metadata including originator, phase, and resource goals.

- **Participant Commitments**  
  Securely allows contributions with caps, velocity throttling, and reclaim/redemption logic.

- **Originator Resource Claiming**  
  Supports time-delayed disbursements for large sums and immediate claims for smaller amounts.

- **Stewardship Transfers**  
  Enables seamless transitions of initiative ownership with approval and validation.

- **Velocity Control System**  
  Limits the rate of operations per participant to prevent abuse.

- **Resource Redemption**  
  Participants can reclaim or redeem resources from paused or expired initiatives.

## üì¶ Architecture Overview

### Data Maps
- `InitiativeArchive`: Core record for each innovation initiative.
- `ParticipantLedger`: Ledger tracking participant contributions.
- `ParticipantVelocityControl`: Anti-abuse operation tracking.
- `WithdrawalQueue`: Delays large withdrawals.
- `StewardshipTransitions`: Tracks approved successor originators.

### Key Constants
- `MAXIMUM_PARTICIPANT_COMMITMENT`: Contribution cap.
- `SIGNIFICANT_ALLOCATION_LEVEL`: Threshold triggering delay.
- `COOLING_PERIOD`: Time-lock before large withdrawals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functions Overview

| Function | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `commit-resources` | Simple resource commitment to an initiative. |
| `secure-resource-commitment` | Validated and capped contribution. |
| `velocity-controlled-commitment` | Adds rate limiting to resource commitment. |
| `reclaim-resources` | Reclaims from expired initiatives. |
| `process-resource-redemption` | Redeems from paused initiatives. |
| `claim-allocated-resources` | Finalizes a successful initiative. |
| `schedule-resource-claim` | Initiates a delayed claim. |
| `execute-scheduled-claim` | Finalizes a delayed claim. |
| `prepare-stewardship-transfer` | Transfers stewardship to a new originator. |

## üß™ Testing & Deployment

To test and deploy the smart contract:
```bash
clarinet check        # Run linting & type check
clarinet test         # Execute unit tests
clarinet deploy       # Deploy to devnet or testnet
```

## üîê Security Considerations

- All operations are gated with strict assertions and conditions.
- Sensitive transfers are protected with cooling periods and withdrawal queues.
- Originator-only operations are enforced with principal verification.
